This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.12.


clone this repo and run:

   * `npm i`

   * `json-server --watch db.json` - navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see data, due to CORS mechanism I used json-server filled with data from `https://swapi.co/api/planets/`

   * `ng serve` - navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see the app, app will automatically reload if you change any source file

   * `ng build` - if you want to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
